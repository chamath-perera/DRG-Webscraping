DRG-Webscraping
======================

### Simple python script to scrape costs from Find-A-Code.

The script takes a list of DRG codes and webscrapes them one by one and returns their costs. This allows the user to avoid spending time scrolling through various web pages to find costs, as this is automated and returned as a table.

Run the Webscraping_fn.py script to run the function. 

``` python
#Function to scrape costs from Find-A-Code.

webscrape_DRG("453","570","946","947", "642", "543", "948")

```
